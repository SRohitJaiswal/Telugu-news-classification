# Telugu-news-classification

The advancement of information technology has resulted in the accumulation of a large number of text documents. The majority of the time, researchers worked on English text documents but now millions of documents are available in Indian regional languages. In today's world, numerous digitized Telugu text documents are generated daily at government websites, news portals, and public and private sectors, and they must be effectively classified into various mutually exclusive pre-defined categories. For easy retrieval, these digitized documents must be classified into a class based on their content. Text Classification, a subset of Text Mining, can assist with this issue. The act of classifying documents is known as text classification and manually classifying these documents is an expensive and time-consuming task. Automatic classification can help with better document management and retrieval. In this project, we have shown the results obtained in by using the methodologies like Heapâ€™s law and n-gram models.
